## Customization Instructions

Follow these steps to personalize your portfolio:

1.  **Download or Clone:**
    *   Download the ZIP of this repository or clone it using Git:
        ```bash
        git clone <repository-url>
        cd <repository-directory>
        ```

2.  **Edit `index.html`:**
    *   Open `index.html` in a text editor.
    *   **Home Section (`<section id="home">`):**
        *   Update the main headline: Change `<h1>Jane Doe / Web Developer</h1>` to your name and title/role.
        *   Review the tagline `p.tagline` and modify if needed.
    *   **About Section (`<section id="about">`):**
        *   Update your biography: Modify the text within the `<div class="bio">` paragraphs. Replace "Jane Doe" and "Web Developer" with your details.
        *   Customize your skills: Edit the `<li>` elements within `<ul class="skills-list">`. Add or remove skills as appropriate.
    *   **Projects Section (`<section id="projects">`):**
        *   For each `<div class="project-card">`:
            *   **Project Image:** Replace the placeholder image URL in `<img src="...">`. It's recommended to create an `images` folder in the root of your project (e.g., `images/project1.jpg`) and link to your images like `src="images/your-project-image.jpg"`. Update the `alt` text for accessibility.
            *   **Project Title:** Change `<h3>Project Title X</h3>`.
            *   **Project Description:** Update the `<p class="project-description">`.
            *   **Technologies Used:** Modify the `<span>` tags within `<div class="project-technologies">`.
            *   **Project Links:** Update the `href="#"` in `<a href="#" ...>GitHub</a>` and `<a href="#" ...>Live Demo</a>` to point to your actual project repositories and live URLs.
        *   Add or remove project cards as needed by copying or deleting the entire `<div class="project-card">...</div>` block.
    *   **Contact Section (`<section id="contact">`):**
        *   Update email link: Change `mailto:your.email@example.com`.
        *   Update LinkedIn link: Change `https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`.
        *   Update GitHub link: Change `https://github.com/yourusername`.
        *   (Optional) Add or modify other social media links. The icon placeholders like `[E]`, `[Li]` are just text; you can replace them with actual SVG icons or remove them if you prefer a cleaner look without icons.
    *   **Footer (`<footer>`):**
        *   Update the copyright notice: Change `<p>&copy; 2023 My Name</p>` to your name and the current year.

3.  **Style Customizations (`style.css`):**
    *   For more advanced visual changes (colors, fonts, layout adjustments beyond content), you can modify `style.css`.
    *   The CSS is commented to help you find relevant sections.

4.  **Favicon (Optional):**
    *   Replace or add a favicon by linking it in the `<head>` of `index.html`. Example:
        ```html
        <link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
        ```

## Deployment

This is a static website, meaning it consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that don't require a backend server. You can host it on various platforms, including:

*   **GitHub Pages:** Free hosting directly from your GitHub repository.
*   **Netlify:** Offers free hosting for static sites with continuous deployment from Git.
*   **Vercel:** Another excellent platform for static sites and frontend frameworks, also with free options.
*   Any web hosting provider that supports static files.

Simply upload the contents of this repository (your `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and any `images` folder) to your chosen hosting provider.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including responsive design features (flexbox, grid).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Currently, `script.js` is included but empty. It's ready for any future interactivity you might want to add.
